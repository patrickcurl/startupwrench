### Third party providers

If you would like to support other providers, please make them available as a Composer package, then link to them
below.

These providers allow integration with other providers not supported by `jobs-common`. They may require an older version
so please help them out with a pull request if you notice this.

### Build your own providers

New providers can be created by cloning the layout of an existing package. When choosing a name for your package, please donâ€™t use the `jobbrander` vendor prefix, as this implies that it is officially supported.

You should use your own username as the vendor prefix, and prepend `jobs-` to the package name to make it clear that your package works with Jobs Client. For example, if your GitHub username was prometheus, and you were implementing the Dice.com job listing library, a good name for your composer package would be `prometheus/jobs-dice`.

#### Implementing your own provider

If you are working with a job listing service not supported out-of-the-box or by an existing package, it is quite simple to implement your own. Simply extend `JobBrander\Jobs\Client\Providers\AbstractProvider` and implement the required abstract methods:

```php
abstract public function createJobObject($payload);
abstract public function getFormat();
abstract public function getListingsPath();
abstract public function getUrl();
abstract public function getVerb();
```

Each of these abstract methods contain a docblock defining their expectations and typical behaviour. Once you have
extended this class, you can simply follow the example above using your new `Provider`.

Each job object that is created will automatically set `source` and `query` based on the criteria passed into the provider. If you would like to customize this `source` value, your provider must implement a `getSource` method that returns a string to identify your provider's source.

#### Make your provider official

If you want to transfer your provider to the `jobbrander` GitHub organization and add it to the list of officially supported providers, please open a pull request on the jobbrander/jobs-common package. Before new providers will be accepted, they must have 100% unit test code coverage, and follow the conventions and code style used in other Jobs Client providers.
