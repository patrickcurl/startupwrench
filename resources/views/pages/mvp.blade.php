<h1> MVP For $4K </h1>

<p>Launching soon, I will build a FULL functioning MVP (complexity of 45 days max) for $4k (1k down + 10% equity, 3k upon launch of app). Currently I can only take on 1-2 projects at a time though, and for sake of speed, apps will be built in laravel, which is what this site is built on.</p>

<p>  It's very important that you have a clear picture of what the absolute minimum proof of concept should be, and I highly recommend following the lean-startup methodology by building a lean canvas and testing out your app idea, it'll save you tons of heartache. Having been in one of the nations top-ten accelerators (BoomStartup) I have a bit of experience with lean canvassing, etc and would be more than happy to help with that.</p>

Stay tuned... for more information.
