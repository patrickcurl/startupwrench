Hey, 

I'm going through the list at: https://startuplister.com/list-of-startup-directories/
Submitting my startup to anyone who will listen and check it out - you were on that list. :-). 

  http://www.startupwrench.com
Basically, it's a curated list of tools, and resources relating to startups. 
It's built in laravel, and has instant search (type 3 or more characters in the search bar).. 

I've got a lot more that I'm planning on adding in the future. 
Let me know what you think. 

Regards,
Patrick Curl
